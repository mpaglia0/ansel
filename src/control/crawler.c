 * its XMP exist and when was it last written, is there a .txt/.TXT/.wav/.WAV beside it -- and
 * used to answer each one with its own stat(). On a network filesystem the round-trip, not the
 * work, is the entire cost: measured at 8.1 ms per stat() on a GVFS/SMB share, a 1969-image
 * library spent 102 s in dt_control_crawler_run() before the main window was ever built.
 *
 * One directory listing answers all six questions for every image in that folder, and carries
 * the modification times with it -- SMB returns them in the listing itself, so the XMP
 * timestamp costs nothing beyond the listing. Same library, same share: 1.1 s for 3967 entries
 * across 18 folders.
 *
 * Do NOT "improve" this by parallelising the per-file lookups instead. That was measured on
 * the same share and does not work: gvfsd-fuse multiplexes every FUSE request through a single
 * daemon, so 4 threads gained 4% (inside the noise) and 64 threads ran twice as slow as one.
 * What this path needs is fewer round-trips, not overlapping ones.

 * exact name misses and built on that first miss -- a library whose names all agree with the
 * database never pays for it.
 *
 * That index is a FILTER, not an answer. It says a file exists under some other spelling;
 * whether the database's own spelling resolves to it is the filesystem's call, so a stat() of
 * that spelling decides -- the very question the per-file code asked, put to the same
 * filesystem. Found where the filesystem folds case; "missing" where it does not (ext4), and
 * rightly: there the database's name really names no file, and taking the other one would
 * hand this image another file's sidecar and companions. That costs one stat() per name that
 * exists only under another spelling, which on an agreeing library is none.
 *
 * The key is Unicode-normalised before it is folded: macOS stores names decomposed, and a
 * database may carry the composed spelling of the same name. The stat() is what makes a
