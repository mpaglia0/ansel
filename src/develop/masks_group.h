/** @file develop/masks_group.h
 *
 * @brief Ask the masks module about a shape or a group, instead of reading its structs.
 *
 * @details Part of the enclosure of src/develop/masks (issue #1299, phase P2). Eight files outside
 * the module reach directly into dt_masks_form_t and dt_masks_form_group_t; this is where the
 * questions they are really asking get names.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIRST PARAMETER MEANS -- the convention that replaces per-function threading notes:
 *
 *   GList *forms first            -- resolve against a borrowed refcounted snapshot (pipe->forms,
 *                                    hist->forms). No lock, no copy-on-write, read-only.
 *   const dt_masks_form_t * first -- an already-resolved handle. Thread-neutral: reads only that
 *                                    object's own memory. No lock, no copy-on-write.
 *   dt_develop_t *dev first       -- touches the live list. Returns dt_masks_result_t => it writes,
 *                                    and owns the lock and the copy-on-write internally.
 *
 * Only the resolvers come in pairs, which is what makes a cross-thread resolve visible at the call
 * site rather than invisible.
 *
 * Everything crosses this boundary BY VALUE (dt_masks_form_info_t, dt_masks_member_t). A caller
 * never holds a pointer into a refcounted form: the next dt_masks_cow_touch() replaces the object
 * wholesale, so such a pointer is a use-after-free waiting for a slow enough reader.
 *
 * This header includes develop/masks_types.h and nothing else -- in particular no GTK, unlike
 * develop/masks_gui.h. Model: develop/masks/masks_history.h, which already compiles against an
 * opaque dt_masks_form_t on tag declarations alone.

 * came from may be gone.
 *
 * THESE TOKENS ARE PERSISTED. They build the conf keys plugins/darkroom/<plugin>/<type>/<feature>
 * declared in data/anselconfig.xml.in (".../polygon/fading" and friends), so the polygon token
 * is "polygon" and can never become "path": a shape reading a key that is not in confgen gets 0,

 * may not resolve the row first: cloning a group clones its membership blocks too, so an entry
 * pointer taken before the touch belongs to the abandoned copy and the mutation lands nowhere.
