 * Forms are refcounted instead of deep-copied: dt_masks_snapshot_current_forms()
 * and dt_masks_replace_current_forms() share pointers with dev->forms rather than
 * cloning the whole flat list. A form is only cloned, on the spot, the moment it
 * is actually about to be mutated while something else still references it
