/* The outline of a shape, as its consumers read it.
 *
 * A brush and a polygon both publish two index-aligned arrays: a centreline (the brush's spine,
 * the polygon's path) and a border, one border sample per centreline sample, at the shape's
 * local radius along the normal. The rasteriser paints the spokes between the two; what the GUI
 * draws is the BOUNDARY of what the rasteriser paints. This file holds what deciding that
 * boundary needs, and the one geometric choice the two shapes make the same way at a joint.
 * It knows nothing about nodes, handles or payloads. */

/* THE BOUNDARY OF A SHAPE.
 *
 * The rasteriser paints every spoke it is given, and it should: each one is a radius of a disc
 * the stroke is the union of, so a spoke that lies inside another spoke's disc paints nothing
 * new and costs nothing but time. The DRAWN outline is another matter. It is the boundary of
 * that union, and a border sample that lies inside some other disc is not on it -- it is the
 * inner side of a fold where the centreline bends tighter than its own radius, the inside of
 * a joint arc, a cap swallowed by the next segment, or one side of the stroke running through
 * the other. Every one of those used to be found AFTER the fact, by intersecting the outline
 * with itself and cutting the loops out, and every ordering of those cuts moved the artefact
 * somewhere else (issues #1352 and #1360; the three attempts recorded at the previous version
 * of this function). The question the cuts were approximating is answered here directly, per
 * sample: is this border sample strictly inside any other sample's disc? If so it is not on
 * the boundary and the outline does not show it. Nothing is intersected and nothing is
 * chosen between.
 *
 * Two searches, because the discs that can hide a sample come from two places, and what
 * separates them is their INDEX along the walk, not their position. A disc within twice the
 * largest radius of the sample's own spine position can reach it and no other can, so a
 * window of discs either side of the sample's own is exhaustive for folds, joints and caps;
 * consecutive discs move at most a step, so the window is scanned in blocks and a block whose
 * first disc is out of reach is skipped whole. The stroke can also come back on itself -- a
 * hairpin, a crossing, a spiral -- and then the hiding disc is any distance away along the
 * walk but within one radius in the plane. A bucket grid of one reach per cell finds those,
 * and each bucket holds its discs as RUNS of consecutive indices: a run inside the window is
 * the near part, already answered, and is dismissed in one comparison; only runs from far
 * along the walk are tested disc by disc. On a stroke that never revisits its own ground that
 * is nothing at all, and at a crossing it is the discs of the other pass and no more.
 *
 * A first version used a coarse occupancy map of the union for the far part instead. It was
 * conservative, and so it left every sample within a few pixels of a far boundary undecided;
 * refining those exactly meant refining every sample, because every boundary sample is within
 * a few pixels of its OWN stroke's interior, and the build went from 30 ms to 250 ms on the
 * corpus. Position cannot tell near from far; the index can.
 *
 * Cost is bounded by decimation, not by the sample count: consecutive samples closer than half
 * a pixel with the same radius are one disc, so the window and the grid both see a few
 * thousand discs on a stroke of a hundred thousand samples. */
