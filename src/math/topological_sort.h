/**
 * @file topological_sort.h
 * @brief Small directed-graph helper for constraint aggregation and topological sorting.
 *
 * This module provides:
 *  - A node model (@ref dt_digraph_node_t) with per-node constraint sets.
 *  - A "flatten" step that canonicalizes nodes by string id and aggregates constraints.
 *  - A depth-first-search topological sort.
 *  - A one-shot cleanup API to free all nodes/constraints/ids (and optionally node payloads).
 *
 * ## Key concepts
 *
 * ### Nodes
 * A node is identified by @ref dt_digraph_node_t::id (a NUL-terminated UTF-8 string).
 * Nodes also carry an opaque payload pointer @ref dt_digraph_node_t::user_data.
 *
 * ### Constraints
 * Constraints are stored per node as a list (@ref dt_digraph_node_t::constraints) of
 * @ref dt_digraph_node_constraints_t*. Each constraint is interpreted *relative to the node
 * owning it*:
 *
 * - If constraint->previous is non-NULL: it means `previous` MUST be ordered before `self`.
 *   This creates a directed edge: `previous -> self`.
 * - If constraint->next is non-NULL: it means `next` MUST be ordered after `self`.
 *   This creates a directed edge: `self -> next`.
 *
 * A node may have **more than one constraint set**, represented by multiple
 * @ref dt_digraph_node_constraints_t objects in its list.
 *
 * ### Flattening / canonicalization
 * In some pipelines, nodes may be duplicated (same id) while each duplicate declares
 * different constraints. @ref flatten_nodes() merges (canonicalizes) such duplicates:
 *
 * - Produces one canonical node per id.
 * - Aggregates all constraint objects onto the canonical node's constraint list.
 * - Ensures constraint endpoints (previous/next) point to canonical nodes as well.
 *
 * The resulting node list is suitable for @ref topological_sort().
 *
 * ## Ownership and lifetime
 *
 * This module assumes that canonical nodes created by @ref flatten_nodes() own:
 *  - node->id (duplicated with g_strdup())
 *  - each dt_digraph_node_constraints_t object in node->constraints
 *  - the node object itself
 *
 * Pointers stored in dt_digraph_node_constraints_t::previous/next are **non-owning references**
 * to other nodes; they must never be freed via the constraint object.
 *
 * The cleanup helper @ref dt_digraph_cleanup_full() frees canonical nodes, their ids,
 * their constraint lists, and each constraint object. It can optionally free user_data
 * using a callback.
 
 * dt_digraph_cleanup_full(flat, NULL, my_user_data_destroy);
