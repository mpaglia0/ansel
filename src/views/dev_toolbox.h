 * Buttons with an options popover (everything except ISO 12646) also get one
 * built here, anchored via dt_dev_toolbox_connect_popover() and filled with
 * the controls generic enough to make sense for any view (thresholds,
 * mode/colorscheme, profile picker, background brightness/margins). The
 * popover's content box is a plain GtkBox, retrievable with
 * gtk_bin_get_child(GTK_BIN(dev->X.floating_window)): a caller wanting extra,
 * view-specific controls (e.g. darkroom's rendering-size and
 * mask-preview-checkerboard additions to Picture display's popover) packs
 * them into that same box and calls gtk_widget_show_all() itself once done —
 * this function does not call it, so callers control when the popover is
 * considered fully assembled. Softproof and gamut still share one popover,
 * built only once both are present in the same call.
 *
 * Accelerators are NOT wired here — see dt_dev_toolbox_add_accels() — so
