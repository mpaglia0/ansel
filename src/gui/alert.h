 * A toast goes away by itself; this is for what stays true after it would have -- a module that
 * failed, an image that was not updated. Nothing waits for the answer: the call returns at once,
 * and the rest of the application stays usable while the window is up.
 *
 * One window per kind of message -- per title and message -- which shows the message once and,
 * under it, the items it was raised for, each once, in a list that scrolls past a height. A
 * failure that repeats -- a module failing on every thumbnail of a film roll -- stays one window
 * that lists which images it hit, instead of stacking windows or keeping only the last one. A
 * repeat that adds nothing leaves the window as it is.
 *
 * So the message says what went wrong, never where: the same text at every call from one place,
 * built with no value in it. What changes from one call to the next -- a file, a module, a
 * profile -- is the item.
 *
 * Any thread: the window is built later, from the GUI thread's main loop, out of copies of the
 * arguments -- never inside the call, so a caller holding a lock may alert.
 *
 * @param title   the window's title and the bold line at the top, already translated; one line
 * @param message the text under it, already translated; plain text, not markup
 * @param item    one line of the list under it -- an image's full path, or a module's name and
 *                the image; plain text. NULL when there is nothing to list.
