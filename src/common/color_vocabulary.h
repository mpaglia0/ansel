/**
 * @brief Name the colour at @p color in plain language, e.g. "salmon" or "olive drab".
 *
 * @details Classifies by hue and lightness against a 15 x 5 grid of names, after two
 * special cases: a chroma below 2.0 is "gray", and a colour falling inside the measured
 * spread of any reference skin tone is named as such instead ("average Thai skin tone"),
 * listing every ethnicity whose range it matches, one per line.
 *
 * @param color CIE Lab 1976 turned into polar coordinates (Lch), as produced by
 * dt_Lab_2_LCH(): L in percent, chroma, and hue NORMALIZED to [0, 1] -- not degrees.
 * Passing degrees puts every lookup out of the table's domain.
 *
 * @return a newly-allocated, translated, human-readable name. **The caller owns it and
 * must g_free() it.** Never NULL: a colour outside the table's domain gives
 * "color not found" rather than a NULL a "%s" would then read.
 *
 * @note Ownership used to depend on which branch answered -- the skin-tone path returned
 * an allocated string while every other path returned a static literal, behind a
 * `const char *` that told the caller neither. The one call site leaked whenever a skin
 * tone matched. Allocating on every path is what makes the contract statable.
