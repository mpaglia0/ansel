/** @file database/removed_image_repository.h
 *
 * @brief `memory.removed_*`: the staging area behind "undo remove from library".
 *
 * @details Removing an image from the library deletes its `main.images` row, and the
 * foreign keys take its history, masks, tags, colour labels, metadata and module order
 * down with it. Nothing about that is recoverable from the file on disk -- the raw is
 * still there, but the edit is not -- so the rows are copied into `memory.` twins first
 * and copied back to undo the removal. Every function here is a bulk table-to-table copy,
 * which is why the rows never become C structs: the same reason
 * database/history_snapshot_repository.h gives.
 *
 * The twins are declared in database.c by `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` over the live
 * tables, so their columns follow whatever `main` holds and a schema migration needs no
 * edit here. Each carries two extra leading columns, `snap_id` and `undo_imgid`, which is
 * the key every function below takes.
 *
 * `common/image.c` keeps the undo bookkeeping -- when a snapshot is taken, what the undo
 * and redo halves do with it, and when it is dropped.

/**
 * @brief Copy every row @p imgid owns out of `main`, so the removal about to happen can be undone.
 *
 * @details Call this BEFORE anything touches the image: the group membership of the images
 * staying behind is part of the snapshot, and removing a group's leader rewrites it.
 *
 * The snapshot id is allocated here rather than asked for separately, so that reading the
 * highest id an image already has and writing rows under the next one happen inside the same
 * transaction.
 *
 * @return The snapshot id, to be handed back to restore() and clear(), or -1 when a statement
 *         failed. The whole thing is one transaction and rolls back in that case, and the
 *         caller must remove the image without an undo record rather than record one that
 *         cannot restore anything.
