/* Every table a removed image owns rows in, listed in the order a restore has to put them
 * back: the film roll before the image whose film_id references it, the image before
 * everything keyed on its id. `filter` is how the table is matched to one image while
 * staging -- a film roll is reached through the image rather than by a column of its own,
 * and `meta_data` spells the image column `id` where the rest spell it `imgid`.
 *
 * `child_key` names that column again for the tables the restore must CLEAR before it
 * copies back, and is NULL for the two that are not the image's children -- its film roll,
 * which other images share, and the image row itself, which a restore must never delete.
 * Clearing matters because the schema does not cascade uniformly: `module_order`,
 * `color_labels` and `meta_data` carry no foreign key on images(id), so their rows outlive
 * the removal, and `color_labels` has no unique constraint either -- copying the staged row
 * on top of a survivor would duplicate it, and duplicate it again on every further
 * remove/undo cycle. Clearing first makes the restore idempotent and independent of which
 * tables the schema happens to cascade. */
