 * the destination keeps its absolute noise and texture amplitude on a darker base: once encoded
 * for display, that noise is stronger than the destination's own.

 * SQRT interpolates the difference of square roots, the variance-stabilising transform of shot
 * noise, so the pasted noise takes the amplitude it would have had at the destination level. Only
