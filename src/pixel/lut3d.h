 * @brief Apply one interpolation model over a packed RGB CLUT.
 *
 * @details
 * The interpolation always happens in the normalized `[0, 1]` lattice domain.
 * `normalization` lets callers map scene-referred RGB into that domain before
 * lookup and restore the white level afterwards without rescaling the whole
 * buffer in separate passes.
 *
 * All modules using a dense RGB CLUT should go through this shared runtime so
 * file-backed LUTs and procedurally-generated LUTs only differ by how they
 * author the lattice values, not by how they traverse the cells.
