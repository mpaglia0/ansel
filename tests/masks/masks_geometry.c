/** Rasterised geometry for mask shapes that are known to break.
 *
 * Every shape here is a defect that shipped, reduced to the geometry that causes it. The
 * runner rasterises each one, writes the alpha as a PNG, and reports simple, stable measures
 * of it -- coverage, and the count and size of enclosed holes. Those numbers are the
 * regression signal; the PNGs are how a human sees what the numbers mean.
 *
 * Why measures and not a golden-image diff: the rasteriser's exact anti-aliasing is allowed to
 * change, and a byte comparison would fail on every legitimate improvement while still missing
 * a hole that moved. A hole is what these bugs ARE, so a hole is what is counted.
 *
 * The overlay is rendered too, over the alpha, because the two layers are confused so easily:
 * a brush cusp losing coverage and a dashed outline drawing self-intersecting circles are
 * different bugs, and an always-FALSE flag once deleted geometry the rasteriser needed in
 * order to tidy a line the GUI drew. Seeing them superimposed is what tells them apart.
 *
 * Run: ansel-test-masks-geometry [output-dir]

 * the rasteriser owed and did not deliver.
 *

 * bites INTO the stroke from outside -- it is open, connected to the background, and no
 * hole-counting metric will ever flag it. Measuring against the disc union does, and it says
 * what the user said: the brush lost its radius near the cusp.
 *
 * The same construction, run the other way, answers the question issue #1360 asks: coverage
 * the rasteriser delivered that NO disc owes. A border sample that lands far from its
 * centreline paints a spoke out to wherever it landed, and the mask grows a region the stroke
 * never covered -- in that report, a circle spanning the whole frame. The owed map cannot see
 * it: every owed pixel is painted, and then some. So two maps are built from the same discs:
 * OWED, the smaller radius shrunk by two pixels, which the mask must cover entirely; and
