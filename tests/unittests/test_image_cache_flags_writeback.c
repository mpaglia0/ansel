/** Why anything writing `main.images.flags` behind the image cache has to keep the cache
 * in step.
 *
 * A cache entry holds its own dt_image_t, and releasing it writes that WHOLE struct back --
 * which is how a rating reaches the database (metadata/ratings.c). So a row updated straight
 * through the repository while a stale entry sits in the cache is not durable: the next
 * release of that entry overwrites it, at a moment nothing connects to the update.
 *
 * The XMP crawler is the caller this was found on (control/crawler.c). It takes the entry and
 * edits it when there is one, and writes the row only when there is not; these tests pin both
 * halves of that reasoning -- the hazard, and the sequence that avoids it.
