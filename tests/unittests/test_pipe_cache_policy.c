/** Which pipeline nodes must keep a host-RAM copy of their output.
 *
 * These tests exist because nothing else can see this. The per-piece cache_output_on_ram flag
 * changes no exported pixel -- the export path drives the pipe directly and never reaches the
 * seal that computes it -- changes no hash, and produces no log unless someone is already
 * looking. When it was wrong, the symptom was a downstream module reading stale host bytes
 * from a rekeyed cacheline, only with OpenCL enabled, and it was found by dumping GPU buffers.
 *
 * The propagation test below is that bug, pinned.

 * being carried is "the node that CONSUMES my output reads it from RAM". That is a fact about
 * one edge of the graph; the node before me publishes to a consumer of its own and knows
 * nothing about mine. Carrying it made the flag monotone, and since the seal seeds the walk
 * with TRUE for the displayed final output, EVERY enabled node inherited it: measured on a
 * painting stroke, 152 MB and 68.1 ms of a 113.8 ms frame spent copying module outputs to RAM,
 * of which only the last node's 11.7 MB was ever read from RAM by anything.
 *
 * The defect the transitive version was written for is real but lives elsewhere: a node whose
 * requirement turns back ON can be handed a cacheline whose host copy was never refreshed
 * while the requirement was off. `_seal_opencl_cache_policy()` invalidates the line on that
 * edge. Keeping every host copy fresh forever also prevented it, at the cost above.
