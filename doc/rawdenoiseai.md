# Neural raw denoising (rawdenoiseai)

This page documents the design of the `rawdenoiseai` module: what the neural
network actually is, what problem it solves, what is computed offline versus
at runtime, and why none of it involves sending anything anywhere.

**Executive summary for the worried:** this module is the next generation of
content-aware denoising and, mathematically, the next generation of
least-squares fitting. It shares no technology, no infrastructure and no
failure modes with chatbots or image generators. It is a fixed list of numbers,
fitted once on public data, applied deterministically to your pixels, entirely
on your machine.

[TOC]

## A neural network is a curve fit, not a chatbot

Photographers have been using fitted models for decades without calling them
"AI". It is worth walking up the ladder of familiar examples, because the
neural denoiser sits on the same ladder — just higher.

**Rung 1 — the least-squares line.** Given observed pairs $(x_k, y_k)$, fitting

$$y = a x + b$$

means finding the two numbers $(a, b)$ that minimize the total error

$$(\hat a,\hat b) = \arg\min_{a,b} \sum_k \left(y_k - (a x_k + b)\right)^2 .$$

Two things happen at two different times: an *optimizer* finds the parameters
once (fitting), then the model is *applied* forever after by plain arithmetic
(evaluation). Applying $y = \hat a x + \hat b$ involves no optimizer, no data,
no judgment — it is a pocket-calculator operation.

**Rung 2 — the ICC input matrix.** A camera input profile contains a $3\times3$
color matrix: nine numbers fitted, by exactly the same least-squares logic,
against measured color-checker patches, so that

$$\begin{pmatrix} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{pmatrix} = M \begin{pmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{pmatrix}$$

maps camera RGB to a standard space with minimal error over the patches. Nine
fitted parameters instead of two; applied to every pixel of every photograph
you develop; nobody has ever called a display profile "artificial
intelligence". The profile is a bag of numbers produced by an optimizer that
ran once, elsewhere, on reference data.

**Rung 3 — the neural denoiser.** Same recipe, three quantitative changes:

| | least-squares line | ICC matrix | neural denoiser |
|---|---|---|---|
| parameters | 2 | 9 | ~1.9 M (distilled) / ~7.6 M (full) |
| model form | linear | linear | stacked $3\times3$ convolutions + pointwise nonlinearity |
| fitted against | observed $(x, y)$ pairs | measured color patches | millions of (noisy, clean) image patch pairs |
| fitting happens | once, offline | once, at profiling time | once, offline (`ansel-denoise` repo) |
| evaluation | arithmetic | one matrix per pixel | convolutions per pixel |

"Training" *is* the fitting step. "Inference" *is* the evaluation step. The
epistemology is identical to the least-squares line: an optimizer minimizes an
error over known pairs, and what comes out is a **fixed set of numbers**.

**Why millions of parameters?** Because noise and fine detail are both
high-frequency signals. Any *linear* filter that attenuates high frequencies
attenuates both: that is why classical denoising always trades detail for
smoothness. Telling them apart is a *statistical judgment about context* —
"this oscillation continues the foliage texture around it; that one is
uncorrelated with anything and has exactly the amplitude the sensor's noise
model predicts at this brightness". A judgment conditioned on local context
cannot be encoded in 2 or 9 numbers; it needs a model expressive enough to
represent "what natural image textures look like, at every scale, versus what
sensor noise looks like". The millions of parameters buy a *content-aware,
spatially adaptive* filter — nothing more mystical than that.

## The task: fitting noisy against ground truth

The sensor noise model is the same one Ansel has shipped for years in
`data/noiseprofiles.json`: for a normalized raw value $x$, the observed value is

$$y = x + n, \qquad \mathrm{Var}(n) = a\,x + b$$

per RGB channel — $a$ is the photon (shot) noise gain, $b$ the read-out
variance, both measured per camera per ISO by the community profiling effort.

The denoiser $f_\theta$ is fitted to undo that corruption:

$$\hat\theta = \arg\min_\theta \;\; \mathbb{E}\; \bigl| f_\theta(y, \sigma) - x \bigr|,
\qquad \sigma(y) = \sqrt{\max(a\,y + b,\, 0)}$$

which the attentive reader will recognize as least-*absolute*-deviation
fitting — the robust L1 sibling of least squares. The pairs $(y, x)$ do not
come from anybody's photo library: clean patches $x$ are harvested from
public, consensually licensed images (raw.pixls.us CC0 archive, the PlayRaw
community sharing category), and the noise $n$ is *synthesized* on them by
sampling $(a, b)$ across the entire noise-profile database. The ground truth
is manufactured, which is precisely what makes the method clean: we know the
right answer for every training pair because we corrupted it ourselves.

Feeding $\sigma$ to the network as an input (rather than baking a noise level
into the weights) is what makes **one set of weights serve every camera and
every ISO**: a newly profiled camera is supported the moment its $(a, b)$
entries exist, with no retraining.

## Where the training data comes from

Every training pair is manufactured from two community-built, consensually
licensed ingredients — no private data enters the pipeline at any point:

**Clean image content.** Small tiles ($256\times256$ photosites, CFA-aligned,
base-ISO, well-exposed, the most textured crops of each frame) are harvested
from:

- the [raw.pixls.us](https://raw.pixls.us) archive — raw sample files
  explicitly published under **CC0 (public domain)** by their photographers to
  support open-source raw software development. It covers hundreds of camera
  models, which is what teaches the network every CFA layout and sensor
  readout convention in the wild;
- the [PlayRaw](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/playraw/30) category of the
  pixls.us forum, where photographers post their own raws under **declared
  Creative Commons licenses** expressly for others to process. This
  contributes the *content diversity* — real skin, foliage, night scenes,
  wildlife — that a decoder-testing archive lacks. The license, author and
  source topic of every file are verified at harvest time and recorded per
  tile;
- optionally, maintainer-curated images selected one by one from a personal
  library — the explicit selection being the consent step.

The harvest strips everything but a technical whitelist: tiles carry black and
white levels, CFA pattern, white balance and ISO — **no GPS coordinates, no
serial numbers, no timestamps, no author-identifying EXIF** ever enters a
training shard, even though the source files contain them.

**Noise statistics.** The $(a, b)$ variance lines come from the darktable /
Ansel **community noise-profiling effort** (`data/noiseprofiles.json`) —
hundreds of cameras measured by their owners over more than a decade. The
training samples noise across this entire database, which is why the fitted
network generalizes across sensors.

The whole dataset is **reproducible without redistribution**: a ledger records
every harvest decision (file, license, acceptance or rejection and why), the
sources are pinned by content hash, and the harvested tiles are cached
publicly so anyone can retrain the same model from the same inputs — the same
standard of provenance the noise profiles themselves have always had.

## What the "model" actually is

A `.anselnn` file is, byte for byte:

    8 bytes    magic "ANSELDN1"
    4 bytes    length of a JSON header
    JSON       {"cfg": {architecture constants}, "tensors": [{name, shape, offset, size}, ...]}
    payload    plain float32 arrays — the fitted numbers

That is all. It has the same ontological status as an ICC profile, a lens
correction database entry, or `noiseprofiles.json` itself: **a bag of fitted
constants**. It contains no executable code, no images, no user data. It
cannot observe anything, remember anything, or transmit anything — it is an
argument to a convolution routine.

Nor can it "contain" the training images in any meaningful sense: ~7.6 million
numbers were fitted against billions of pixel observations. What survives the
fitting is the *statistics of the noise-versus-detail distinction*, not
pictures — exactly as $\hat a, \hat b$ of a least-squares line retain the trend
of the data points, not the points.

Finally, the architecture is structurally *subtractive*: the network outputs an
estimate of the noise layer, which is subtracted from the input,

$$\hat x = y - g_\theta(y, \sigma).$$

It can only remove an estimated corruption from your pixels; there is no
mechanism by which it could hallucinate content into them.

## Architecture

The network is a small U-Net: an encoder that halves resolution while doubling
channel count (so deeper levels see wider context at coarser scale), a
bottleneck, and a decoder that mirrors the encoder, re-injecting the encoder's
intermediate results ("skip connections") so fine detail is never lost to the
downsampling.

Every box above is built from one operation the reader already knows from
sharpening and blurring: the $3\times3$ convolution

$$z_o(p) = b_o + \sum_{i} \sum_{\delta \in 3\times3} w_{o,i,\delta}\; u_i(p + \delta)$$

— a weighted average of a pixel's neighborhood. The *only* difference from a
hand-written blur kernel is that the weights $w$ were fitted instead of chosen.
Between convolutions sits the one nonlinearity,

$$\mathrm{GELU}(t) = \tfrac{t}{2}\left(1 + \mathrm{erf}\bigl(t/\sqrt{2}\bigr)\right),$$

a smooth gate that lets a channel respond selectively — this is what upgrades
a stack of averages into a context-dependent filter.

The network operates **before demosaicing**, directly on the mosaic, where
sensor noise is still per-photosite independent. (After demosaicing, the
interpolation correlates noise across neighboring pixels, which destroys the
very statistical signature the fit relies on.) The CFA layout is passed as
explicit input planes, so the same weights handle Bayer and X-Trans.

Everything expensive, data-hungry, and non-deterministic (the optimizer)
happens **offline**, in the [ansel-denoise](https://github.com/aurelienpierreeng/ansel-denoise)
repository, on public data. What ships to the user is the fitted result.

At **runtime**, Ansel evaluates a fixed function. The steps, per image:

1. `commit_params()` looks up the camera's noise profile at the image ISO
   (`dt_noiseprofile_get_matching` / `_interpolate`, generic fallback for
   unprofiled cameras) — the same infrastructure `denoiseprofile` uses.
2. `process()` builds the five input planes; the $\sigma$ map is scaled by the
   user's *strength* parameter (1.0 = trust the profile).
3. The pixelpipe tiles the image (the network's measured receptive field sets
   the tile overlap) and the convolutions run on CPU
   (`src/common/nn_model.c`) or GPU (`data/kernels/rawdenoiseai.cl`) — both
   paths produce the same result within float rounding.
4. The predicted noise plane is subtracted and the denoised mosaic proceeds to
   demosaicing.

The evaluation is **deterministic and versioned**: same raw file, same
parameters, same model version → the same output, today and in ten years. The
module stores the model *version* and *variant* (full / distilled) in the edit
history; a version that has shipped in a stable release is frozen forever, and
any retraining becomes a new version — so updating Ansel never silently
changes the rendering of an existing edit.

| concern | where | when |
|---|---|---|
| collecting training images | offline, public CC sources | once |
| noise synthesis, fitting, validation | offline (`ansel-denoise`) | once per model version |
| model distribution | `models/` dir + sha256 manifest, fetched at build time | at packaging |
| noise profile lookup, $\sigma$ map | runtime, `src/iop/rawdenoiseai.c` | per image |
| convolutions | runtime, CPU/OpenCL | per image |
| your photographs | **never leave the pixelpipe** | — |

## Privacy: everything runs on your computer

This deserves stating bluntly, because "AI" has come to connote cloud
services that harvest their users:

- **No network access at runtime.** The module performs arithmetic on buffers
  inside the pixelpipe, like every other IOP. There is no server, no account,
  no API key, no telemetry, no "usage analytics". Unplug the network cable and
  the module behaves identically.
- **Your images never leave your machine.** Inference is local; the weights
  are read-only at runtime; there is no training code in Ansel. The model
  cannot learn from, remember, or transmit your photographs — it has no
  mechanism to do any of those things, in the same way an ICC profile has no
  mechanism to phone home.
- **The only download is the model file itself**, fetched hash-verified at
  *build* time (like downloading the software), and bundled inside packaged
  builds. Users of nightly or release packages perform no download at all.
- **The training data respected the same ethics.** Clean tiles come from
  archives whose contributors explicitly published their raws under CC
  licenses for exactly this kind of community use; provenance (source, author,
  license) is recorded per training tile in the `ansel-denoise` repo. No
  scraped social media, no unconsenting photographers, no user data.

## What this is not

The public conversation about "AI" is dominated by large language models and
generative image tools. This module is neither, on every axis that matters:

| | LLM / generative AI | rawdenoiseai |
|---|---|---|
| output | invented text/images | your pixels minus estimated noise |
| can hallucinate content | yes, by design | no — structurally subtractive |
| runs | in a datacenter, on their terms | on your CPU/GPU, offline |
| deterministic | no | yes, bit-stable per version |
| size | 10⁹–10¹² parameters | 2–8 million (a 7–30 MB file) |
| training cost | GWh, months, undisclosed data | hours on one GPU, public CC data, reproducible from a public repo |
| relationship to your data | often trains on it | cannot see it |

The honest genealogy of this module is not ChatGPT; it is the least-squares
line, the ICC matrix, and the wavelet shrinkage threshold — fitted models all,
each generation using more parameters to make a finer-grained distinction.
This one has enough parameters to finally make the distinction photographers
actually care about: *noise is not detail*.
