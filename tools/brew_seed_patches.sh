# Put a formula's external patches in Homebrew's download cache when GitHub now serves them with
# a checksum the formula no longer accepts, so that a source build on Intel macOS can proceed.
#
# Measured on the mac nightly of 2026-10-02: llvm 23.1.2 patches itself with
#   https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/compare/1381ad49...40a8c7c0.diff
# and the formula expects sha256 f6dafd76..., but GitHub now serves fa40bc0a.... The content is
# unchanged: GitHub abbreviates the blob hashes on the diff's `index' lines, and the abbreviation
# grew from 13 to 14 characters as the repository grew. Truncating them back to 13 gives the
# expected sha256 exactly. A compare diff is generated, not stored, so this can happen to any
# formula patching from one, and only source builds ever download the patch -- on Intel, where
# Homebrew publishes no bottles, that is every build.
#
# Why a stale checksum is fatal and not just a retry: brew fetches everything up front and then
# builds with network access denied (llvm has had `deny_network_access!` since 2026-09-21), so a
# patch rejected at fetch time is fetched again inside the sandbox and dies there on DNS --
# `Could not resolve host: github.com`, which reads like an outage and is not one.
#
# For each external patch, the file brew would download is fetched here, outside the sandbox.
# If it already matches, nothing is done. Otherwise every shorter abbreviation of the `index'
# hashes is tried, and the file is written at the patch's cached location ONLY when one of them
# reproduces the formula's own sha256. brew then finds it there and verifies it itself, so this
# can never feed a build anything Homebrew did not already approve. When nothing matches, a note
# is printed and the build fails exactly as it would have without this script.
#
# Always exits 0: it is a best effort in front of `brew install`, never a gate.
#
# Usage:
