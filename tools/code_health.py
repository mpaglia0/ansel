"""Build the "code health" panel published alongside the Doxygen API docs.

The panel answers one question: how manageable is this codebase, in numbers that
mean the same thing on darktable and on Ansel. It is generated identically in both
repositories so the two published sites can be read side by side.

Inputs, all optional except the first — a missing tool degrades its own section to
"not available" instead of failing the build:

  doc/api/sqlite3/doxygen_sqlite3.db   Doxygen's own symbol table (GENERATE_SQLITE3),
                                       produced by a fast first Doxygen pass. Gives
                                       symbols per file and the include graph.
  lizard                               cyclomatic complexity (CCN) per function.
  cppcheck                             static analysis without needing a build.
  <clang-tidy report>.json/.txt        clang-tidy findings, when a separate job that
                                       can produce compile_commands.json has run.

Outputs:

  doc/code-health.md          a Doxygen page (picked up by INPUT, themed, searchable)
  doc/code-health.json        the same numbers, machine-readable, for cross-repo diffing

Usage:
  python3 tools/code_health.py --project darktable --source-dir src \\
      [--db doc/api/sqlite3/doxygen_sqlite3.db] [--clang-tidy-log FILE]

# not use subdirectories as modules. They are drawers: groupings of convenience with
# no ownership or interface boundary, so "common is below control" is an assertion
# the code never made and cannot support. Ansel is moving towards real modules, but
# a measure that is meaningful on one side and meaningless on the other cannot
# compare them.
#
# Everything below is derived from the include graph instead, and the primary unit
# is the FILE, which needs no notion of module at all. Directory-level figures are
